More info:
-can you put this under blog section - called 'Top 10 reasons to see an RD' 
http://www.eatrightcolorado.org/repository/CDA_Brochure.pdf

-can we make it responsive so people can check it on their phone? (this isn't a big deal if it is a pain to do!)
-Under Contact info have a link to my FB page https://www.facebook.com/dietarydesigns with a comment that says 'Like us on Facebook!'
-can we put a physical map of the location under the contact page?

ok, now I'm really going onto shutterstock to collect images :)

Notes:  
Services - Link to the 3 services at the bottom, as well as to the pricing page 
About  - mission statement, about Jamie, and credentials, nutritionist or dietitian visual should go in this section (attached in this email), headshot should go here (attached 'cw-jamie-13)
Testimonials (call this section 'Case Studies' instead) - put case studies here 
Why an RD? - delete this section altogether
Contact - contact information section (attached in this email)
Blog - I don't have anything to put into this section yet, but I will let you know as soon as I do

3 services at the bottom of the homepage:
Body Composition - photo of Inbody 230 (attached in this email)  and the blurb attached in this email, also results sheet (attached to email titled 'small1')
Metabolic Testing - photo of Korr (attached titled 'main-products-metacheck-view'), blurb attached in this email (equipment attachment), and results sheet (attached titled 9FG0226-b)

Extra things:
1- I want this quote to be on the home page if possible 'To eat is a necessity, but to eat intelligently is an art' - La Rochefoucauld
2-somewhere I need to put the cancellation policy (probably in services section?) - it's attached to the email I sent you earlier tonight
3-I also need to mention somewhere under services that 'Dietary Designs is able to accept insurance'

THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!
